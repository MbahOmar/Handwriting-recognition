# Handwriting-recognition
The MNIST data set, consisting of 70,000 handwriting samples, is used to predict the number each handwritten image represents.
Each image is 28x28 grayscale pixels, making each a 1D array of 784 numbers. Consistency in flattening each image is sufficient,
and preserving the 2D structure is a priority.
